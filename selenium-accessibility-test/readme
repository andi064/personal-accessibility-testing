Selenium Accessibility Test Project
-----------------------------------

Overview:
This project uses Selenium WebDriverJS and the Mocha testing framework to automate testing of a web page's main navigation and perform an accessibility scan using the axe-core webdriver integration.

How it is built:
- JavaScript with Selenium WebDriverJS for browser automation.
- Mocha as the test runner and Chai for assertions.
- Accessibility scan integrated with @axe-core/webdriverjs.

Output:
- Confirms if the main navigation element loads.
- Runs an accessibility check on the page and logs any violations.
- Fails tests if accessibility violations are found.

How to test:
1. Ensure Node.js and npm are installed.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the tests with `npx mocha` or `npm test`.
4. Review console output for test results and accessibility violations.
5. No output file is created, results can be seen directly on console or cli.
